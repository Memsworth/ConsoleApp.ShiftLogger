# Shift Logger

This is a console application designed to track an employee's shift. When we think of the (Web API/EF) stack, it is usually considered the standard when it comes to enterprise applications. Therefore, the goal of this project was to learn how to create an API and enable the console application to consume it.






## Requirements

- This is an application where a worker's shifts are recorded.
- Created two applications: The Web API and the UI that will call it.
- All validation and user input occur in the UI app.
- Making sure the API's controller is lean. Any logic is handled in a separate "service".
- Using the "code first" approach to create the database by using Entity Framework's migrations tool.
## Lessons Learned

- Writing an API

- Testing API using Swagger

- Testing an API using Postman
